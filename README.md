# Todo App
 Build a minimal full-stack app using the MERN stack (MongoDB for database, Express and Node for backend, and Javascript for frontend) to perform CRUD operations.

Our app will allow users to
    - Create a todo
    - Read todos
    - Update a todo
    - Delete a todo
  This series should enable you understand CRUD operations using MERN stack.
